<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
<p>Revision Date: 02 Oct 2018</p>

<p><strong>In very simple words:</strong></p>
<p>My name is Rishabh Bhardwaj and I am an individual application developer. I run this app as a side hobby project. I
    do not and will never share personal user data. I deeply respect cyber privacy.

    The lifehacks app sends crash logs and general <b>anonymous</b> analytics from every user. Additionally, I collect
    your email address and name when you decide to sign up via Gmail to submit lifehacks. This is done for me to filter
    out users and not allow them to post bad things into the community. Hope this answers most questions. If not, please
    read on. If it doesn't further help, please write to me at the email address mentioned below.</p>

<p><strong>In far more legal and formal words:</strong></p>

<p> Rishabh Bhardwaj built the Lifehacks app as an Ad Supported app. It currently does not support in-app purchases.
    The Lifehacks service is provided by Rishabh Bhardwaj at no cost and is intended for use as is.
</p>
<p>This page is used to inform visitors regarding my policies with the collection, use, and disclosure
    of Personal Information if anyone decided to use the service, Lifehacks.
</p>
<p>If you choose to use lifehacks, then you agree to the collection and use of information in
    relation to this policy. The Personal Information that I collect is used for providing and improving
    the app. I will not use or share your information with anyone at all, ever.
</p>
<p>The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is
    accessible at <a href="terms-and-conditions">www.rish.space/lifehacks/terms-and-conditions</a>.
</p>
<p><strong>Information Collection and Use</strong></p>
<p>For a better experience while using Lifehacks, I may require you to provide us with certain
    personally identifiable information, including but not limited to email addresses of user submitted lifehacks. The
    lifehacks submitted by each of the users is sent to a server hosted on the cloud which I use to filter offensive
    lifehacks / ban future submissions by the offenders.
</p>
<p>The app does use third party services that may collect information used to identify you.</p>
