    <span>Spent 3 months at <a
            href="http://360vr.tesseract.in/">Tesseract</a>, an MIT Media Lab spinoff working closely with <a
            href="http://www.kshitijmarwah.com/ ">Kshitij Marwah</a>, where I co-developed an Android application to capture and view 360 degree image+video with the hardware built there.</span>
    <span>Specifically, I worked on:</span>
    <ul>
        <li>Handling the communication between the camera and the Android app, sending capture requests and transferring
            captured image and video files.
        </li>
        <li>Integrating a 360 degree viewer to view the equirectangular image.</li>
        <li>Automatically creating floormaps post creation of a 360 degree walkthrough of a house. The only input
            required from the user were indicators in the 360 degree image pointing one room to another.
        </li>
        <li>Creating a (ever-so-slightly primitive) VR mode displacing the feed based on distances of the camera from
            its target or otherwise. This wasn't true VR, but I played around to see the possibilities with a
            pre-recorded 360 video.
        </li>
    </ul>
