    <span>I won a scholarship by Tata Trusts and Google Scholarship to take up Udacity's Nanodegree program. I did about 5 out of the 7 projects, and stopped there as I wanted to focus on other more interesting projects. I was fairly confident with Android by the time I started the nano-degree but started it because I had never learnt Android from theory, but a lot of blogs and code reading. Listing the interesting projects:</span>

    <ul>
        <li>Project 4: <a href="https://github.com/crearo/build-it-bigger">Project on Gradle</a></li>
        <li>Project 5: <a href="https://github.com/crearo/make-your-app-material">Material Design</a></li>
    </ul>
