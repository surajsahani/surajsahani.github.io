    Spent a month at Sandhol, a small village in Himachal as a part of my college's rural internship program where we
    taught students of grades 2-6 Math and English at multiple schools. It was quite fun, as we'd teach them things out
    of their course syllabus - looking for patterns, plotting simple graphs and doing a series of fill in the blanks
    with no definite answer - and then quiz them at the end of it.

    Most students were actually quite clever and picked up things much faster than we thought they would, making the
    entire experience super fun and fruitful.
