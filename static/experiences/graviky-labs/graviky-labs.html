    <span>I spent 3 weeks with <a href="http://anirudh.me/">Anirudh Sharma</a>, an MIT Media Lab graduate in Fluid Interfaces, and <a
            href="http://www.niteshkadyan.in/">Nitesh Kadyan</a> tinkering around in their lab in Bangalore.</span>
    <span>I worked on a whole lot of small projects during this period - varying from monitoring <b>ECG on your bi-cycle handle</b> to making a <b>voice controlled interface to control the crazy-flie nano-copter</b> to <b>transferring data over the audio jack</b> on your mobile phone.</span>
