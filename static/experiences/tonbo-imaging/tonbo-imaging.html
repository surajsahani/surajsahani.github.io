    <span>Tonbo Imaging, a camera company that makes thermal cameras for military reconnaissance and commercial security. My work here is to bring up the Qualcomm Snapdragon platform at the application layer, creating a base for vision problems, streaming wirelessly, and work on imaging problems such as false coloring and video stabilization.</span>
    <span>The product is based on modular hardware + a single software that can modelled for different applications; we currently have:</span>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/static/experiences/tonbo-imaging/img-1.jpg">A gun scope</a></li>
        <li><a href="/static/experiences/tonbo-imaging/img-2.jpg">A wireless no-display streamer</a></li>
        <li><a href="/static/experiences/tonbo-imaging/img-4.jpg">A power-over-ethernet no-display streamer</a></li>
        <li><a href="/static/experiences/tonbo-imaging/img-3.jpg">An OEM for other manufacturers to integrate into
            their product</a>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <span>Here's a list of interesting problems I've worked on:</span>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/projects/video-stab">Real-time Video Stabilization</a>
            <br>
            By far the most difficult and interesting problem I've worked on. Ended up with a stable working solution
            that's used in our Android based products.

            Detailing how we managed to create a very modular camera software to fit the use-cases of multiple camera
            variants.
