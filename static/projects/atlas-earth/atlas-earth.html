    <span>I'm putting this up because the is the first time I learnt how important version control is. I was making this and
    after about a weeks worth of effort - remember, no git, no manual drive backup, I accidentally spilled water over my
    laptop. I had to have the hard-disk replaced and there was no way to retrieve it. Sigh - I struggled for about a
    week to recover the source code by decompiling the debug apk I had in my phone, renaming things and making the app
    work again. <b>Very painful!</b></span>

    <span class="lb">The idea to make this however came up because as a child, my father used to quiz me on cities and capitals all the
        time but I'd always struggle to remember our world map. Part learning, part childhood memory!</span>
