    <span>This was one of the first apps I made when learning Android, and I'm quite proud of it! Made sure apps look great from the start :D</span>
    <span>This was inspired from one of the daily quizzes in the Mirror that I used to solve as a kid. And this was much before the Wordament craze - a similar app to compete against your friends to find words in 4x4 grid. I regret not refining this and putting it up on the Playstore. Really could've done so much more with it!</span>
