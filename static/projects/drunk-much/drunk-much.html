    <span>I made this as a freelance gig for a woman who wanted to block her young daughter from calling people while she played around with her phone. The actual solution to the problem was to block the phone app from opening, which was kinda boring.</span>

    <span class="lb">I later changed the app to make it more interesting by blocking you from call and receiving calls when you're not sober, after watching The Internship (a great watch!) a group of 4 software developers working at Google created this application after a week long of frustration because they couldn't come up with a good idea. Was good fun!</span>
