    <span>This is one of the most difficult problems I've worked on and I'm pretty happy with the results so far. This performs real time video stabilization using a gyroscope and calculates time offset automatically with minimal computation (under 4ms on a weak Qualcomm Snapdragon 210 SOC).</span>
    <span><b>My work</b></span>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Rendering:</b>
            <br>
            Using OpenGL for rendering. Rendering was initially based on <a
                    href="https://github.com/google/grafika">Grafika</a>, but I later created a <a
                    href="/projects/lib-graf">video rendering + filters</a> library which is now heavily used at <a
                    href="/experiences/tonbo-imaging">Tonbo in all Android based products</a>.
        </li>
        <li><b>3D + 2D Rotations:</b>
            <br>
            Did not use quaternion rotations as suggested in most video stabilization papers - simple Euler angles
            worked just fine because the change in angles was quite small + there was no question of gimbal lock. I
            also created a mini library for chainable-3D sprite rotations. I also allow for both 3D or 2D only movements
            for comparison. Essentially, stabilization boils down to only one 4x4 matrix multiplication.
        </li>
        <li><b>Gyroscope Data:</b>
            <br>
            Most Android devices provide sensor data at about 200Hz (every 5ms). For a 30 FPS video, that was sufficient
            to get enough gyro data between frames and interpolate it's rotation by integrating the angular velocity.
            Android applies several filters below the HAL on it's sensors to minimize drift, I used the raw gyro sensor
            data.
        </li>
        <li><b>Gyroscope Drift:</b>
            <br>
            Gyrscope drift really wasn't much of a problem - all I cared for was the delta of angular rotation from
            frame to frame (approx. 33ms for a 30FPS video). I did not need to know exact orientation. I also used a
            simple bring back to center mechanism to ensure the crop window came back to the center.
        </li>
        <li><b>Time Offset Calibration:</b>
            <br>
            Instead of tricky manual time offset calculations - for which there are so many papers, I ran a
            simple KLT tracker between 10-20 frames on randomly chosen parts of the image and plotted graphs of movement
            as measured by the gyro vs. the KLT tracker. View <a href="/static/projects/video-stab/img-2.png">here</a>.
            This worked really well and can be configured to be called every minute or so in case there's unexpected
            drift.
        </li>
        <li><b>Bring back to center:</b>
            <br>
            I used a very simple configurable linear vs exponential interpolation to bring the crop window back to
            center. This is necessary to ensure the crop window has enough area to move at all times.
        </li>
        <li><b>Rolling Shutter:</b>
            <br>
            Since this was primarily intended to run on thermal cameras, I had to take into account rolling shutter
            which happens because of line-by-line read-out. Luckily enough, in most of our cameras, I did not observe
            zig-zaggy artifacts and so linear slant correction did the trick.
            <br>
            Even on bayer sensors, except on the Nexus 5, there were very few phones in which I observed noticeable
            rolling shutter for hand-held shake.
