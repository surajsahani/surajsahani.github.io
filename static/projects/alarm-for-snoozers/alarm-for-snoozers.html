    <span class="lb">An Android application with a simple interface to set consecutive alarms from a start time to an end time with
        a given interval, to make sure you wake up tomorrow morning. It uses the stock android clock as the base clock.
        Really is for the snooze lovers!

    <span class="lb">I tried using the alarms that gave you a difficult maths puzzle, but they really didn't work for me. I found
        myself setting a series of 5 alarms every night to make sure I wake up. This app simply automates the process.
