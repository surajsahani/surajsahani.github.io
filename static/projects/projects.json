We used this to track users using DAWebmail, keeping a tab of how often the app is used, viewing user actions- how many webmails are read on the app, how often webmails are deleted from the app, and so on. I later used this at MIT Kumbathon to track how often people call the ambulance/hospital during the Kumbhmela.",
