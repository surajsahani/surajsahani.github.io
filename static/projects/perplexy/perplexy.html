    <span>A general quiz platform I made for the Google Admob challenge '16 in a team of 4. Our core focus was on the interface and design. I'm really happy with the way it came out, and is probably my favorite group college project - mostly because it was self-initiated; no one asked us to do this, but the 4 of us had an itch to do <i>something</i>.</span>

    <span class="lb">Unfortunately, Google never released results for the challenge, and stopped subsequent Admob challenges with no notice. However, the app did pretty well and has >50K installs.</span>
