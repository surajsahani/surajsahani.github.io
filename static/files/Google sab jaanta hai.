Google sab jaanta hai.

You know a lot og religious people tend to say 'sachai to bhagwaan ko pata hai' whenever another person does somethign wrong to you, or to society in general, and were convinced that God will make sure whats to be done will be done?
Well Google has the same authority. They know everything about you man. Ive written about this before, I just cant stop speculating as to when they will decide to conquer the world. To delcare themselves as an entity as close to God as possible.
