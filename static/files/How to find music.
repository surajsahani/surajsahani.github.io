How to find music.
Youtube pretty much governs how much I can discover. If they choose to give me more suggsetions, I get to know more music. If they keep showing me things that Ive seen, I wont ever get to know more songs. So in a sense, discovery of songs is only as far as I try to reach out. 
A frind of mine suggested me to listen to Snow Patrol's chasing car's live performance at Oxegen '09. And since then youtube has been suggesting me different songs played by Snow Patrol and a couple bands that Ive heard before that played at Oxegen.
So your bubble only expands if you provode the soap required.
