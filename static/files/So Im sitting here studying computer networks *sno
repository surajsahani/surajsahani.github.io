So Im sitting here studying computer networks *snore* and think to myself, what is that differs me from an ant? A friend of min once said ants dont feel pain or loss because they are too small to have emotions in them. But wait. What are emotions? And how is it that we all have similar emotions, and that we react in similar ways to similar situations?

I Googled, and this is what the first response said. And it cannot be truer.
We humans --and most other animals -- appear to be equipped with a set of predictable responses to situations. These are the basic emotions - like that of fear, anger, joy, love and sadness. They exist merely for evloutionary purposes. 

Take for example fear. If deer werent afraid of lions, man, Im sure humans wouldnt know there ever existed such creatures. Emotions are what keep us in the food chain, theyre what make us strive for a better livelihood, better food, better shelter, a better spouse, all in effect to keep our species alive - all of this unconciously.
