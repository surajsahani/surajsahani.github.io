Bangalore.

I could have chosen the flashy internship at SocialCops, Delhi. I could have taken the easier road doing easier work. 
But I wanted somethign exciting, something where I'd actually learn something new, make technology impactful. I chose Anirudh Sharma, an MIT Media Labs guy, on the way to startin up with something called Jackboy. I thought it'd be fun, forgetting that all these Indian MIT people are total screw ups when it comes to organizing and scheduling their day. Or hes just really busy with a lot of things. Maybe I havent reached that level of busy yet. haha. But Im happy, This is my second day here, and he has told me to meet him in 20 minutes. Its been 30 minutes since he told me that. :P
Anyway, Im roaming around, currently sitting at Dunkin Donuts, coding. There these couple of people playing fifa next to me. Im going ot ask them to let me play too. Haha. Lets see what they say.

Point. 
I want something exciting in my life. I could have taken the easier option, where I was being payed to go to Social Cops, and work on things I already know. be at a startup that a lot of people have heard of. But I took a risk, and decided to come to Bangalore. Lets see how this turns out :D
