The funny thing about us.

We all crib. Were all upset with the way the govt functions. The way our univ is being run. The way the admin functions. the way an app functions. The way the gardener maintains our football ground. The way she sang a cover of a song. The way our database teacher teaches us.

And when asked what exactly the problem is, the most common answer is 'EVERYTHING'. And we usually burst out with a big smile or a little chuckle, mocking the fact that we even had the courage to ask such a question. 
Insist a little longer and they wont be able to list down more than 3 issues. And solutions? Almost none. Its only when you get down to the real nitty gritties of an issue that you realise why it is the way it is. 
Evolution and systems are set in place over time. On earth, they cant jsut be changed randomly.

Short detour!

Maaaan. I really want to write somethign like Diary of a Martian. 
Like a philosphy book on, TIL xyz about human nature, or natural behaviour. 
Pretending as if the author is an alien scientist here to study about humans and their characteristics.

So its like this.
Once you delve into these problems and you realize the solution isnt as easy as just saying evrerything is the problem, you struggle to find solutions.

You find a solution but that leads to another set of problems, and solving those leads to a compromise. Either you increase fuel capacity to drive longer, but increasing the weight of your rocket, or you fill less but not go as far.
