In the end its just numbers that define you.
Your spirit, your enthusiasm, your charm wont matter if you dont have the grade they need.
You wont be the man you wish you were if you dont have a 6 digit salary in dollars.
Numbers lower your self esteem. Make you wonder if your care free attitude will work in the longer run. But you know what? Its all about knowing the right people. If Einstein had a deadline to figure out the theory of relatvity, Im sure he would have done a million things other than the theory, and wouldve figured it all out on the very last day. Its just about knowing the right people, and getting them to make your life easier.
