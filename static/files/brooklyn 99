So im goign crazy about Brooklyn 99. Im in love with the characters, and have been forcing all my friends to watch it. Even made my mom sit and watch a couple episodes :P

I had downloaded season 1, but dont have season 2. I googled Brooklyn 99 s2e1 and couldnt find any links. I then remembered on link a senior used to watch all sitcoms on. Coke and Popcorn. And googles automatic suggestions suggested Brooklyn 99. The 3rd link lead to coke and popcorn Brooklyn 99 s2e1. 

Fuck. Thats how much Google, the non living search engine can figure out about you. It almost, in some way predicted the future, as it knew that is what Im looking for.
