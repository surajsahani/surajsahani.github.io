There were however many chapters where I realised how this book was primarily targeted for the average American, and my Indian upbringing made several chapters trivial or just obvious. I wish this was taught as a part of our school curriculum, and I hope to keep coming back to the notes I made for this book.",

I enjoyed reading it, but a few chapters through I realized this is much more of a podcast-y listen-to-one-story-a-night kind of book that gives you something to think about, than one you rush through overloading yourself with new ideas and not having enough time to let your brain process each one. It's a collection of thoughtful bed time stories for adults with child like curiosity and wonder, and for that reason I give this book 5 stars."

Where people are just different, sometimes weird, but they're themselves, and you love them anyway. I painted a picture of each character, even different than described, and associated each with a person I know in my life. It reminded me of my friends. It reminded me of a relationship I've never had. It reminded of me and my friend that in a parallel universe might have had their story play out like this.",

The basis of this book is that you must find your Ikigai; that one thing that brings meaning to your life; that act that keeps you happily busy for the rest of your life, your ikigai. Now, as nice as that sounds, doesn't it remind you of the West's *find your passion* motivation? This precisely is my problem with this book; they missed the whole point of what Ikigai might actually mean. I'll go into some depth of what this book should've been about in a blog post later. Overall though, I liked how the book wasn't full of fluff."

The common theme I see here is: 1) each founder was highly driven to just *do something* - it didn't matter what specifically, because every final product started off as something else and evolved into itself. 2) The Internet boom was all about bringing the real world into the digital web - mails became e-mails, magazine columns became blogs, shopping became e-commerce - and those companies that were early won. I picked this book from a reading list I found on HackerNews, and I've enjoyed it. Again, more of a bed time story for an entrepreneurial adult."

However, I don't remember most of the stories in the book, and I wish I did, because they were all very interesting, but apart from making me feel great, and truly understanding that it takes solid hard work, luck, and the right time in history to invent something novel and useful, I don't remember many details. Making notes on things that strike a chord is the only way to make this a useful read. Otherwise, at this point, all I remember is it making me feel good after having read it.",

As a person who has lived his life in two worlds; the world of an Indian upbringing living in a foreign land, I really resonated with how he puts across the contrast between the two in terms of relationships and dating. However, as with most books, there are maybe 5 core ideas here, and they're excellent. The rest is extra fluff from different angles to drive those core ideas and fill up 300 pages. Another book I feel that would've made for a much, much better 3 hour podcast, especially in his voice."

        "review": "Read 20% of it, and realized it is just another self help book that I can read to feel like I'm reading something smart, but until I don't actually apply anything in real life, it's as good as reading fiction. Something I really wish these books did was quiz you / give you situations to act out in, so you can learn to really see what you would do vs what the author is suggesting. Something of the sort of a school textbook with quizzes at the end of each chapter. I will try to finish it because it is a short book, but I find it hard to make it a useful read."

Else it's like reading a fiction book where you know the overall plot but you tend to forget the major details.\nSomething that really struck me is how hard it is to remove your biases, and to write from a neutral lens. For example, while speaking about a religion that has nothing to do with the Greek language, he often praises Greek, and describes the origin of an English word equating it back to the great Greeks - something that dilutes the importance of the actual religion being spoken about, almost placing the Greeks on top.",

It has all the elements of topics & interests I gravitate towards, am fond of, or have people around me speak about.\nIt has Black Mirror vibes, plotted similar to the movie Source Code, with philosophical questions we love asking ourselves about the paths not taken & big decisions that might have changed the course of our lives.\nFunnily enough, it also reminded me of a book series I loved as a child - The Magic Treehouse, which I thought was a hilarious parallel. All in all, I loved the concept, the hook, and the first half was especially fun to read - the end however was much like 'reading a Hollywood movie'.",

I really enjoyed it because it read like a fiction book - based entirely on one man's recollection of his life events. And that's where I'd like to underscore the thing that stood out the most to me - much like a fiction book, the author is always _right_, because it is his story and he is the protagonist - given no matter what hardship, he comes out on top victorious. However, there are parts in the book where he says he hasn't done anything wrong/illegal, and yet you feel he isn't painting the entire picture. All in all though, this was a great motivational read!",

What I loved is how one of the most advanced pieces of technology we had in that day was the mechanical clock; and that's as far as the mind's imagination could go - the clockwork man is a cyborg who functions on advanced mechanical machinery, and the key to his functioning is a complicated clock at the back of its head (!!). The book feels like a lifetime compilation of the author's take on the various aspects of life, science and speculation of the future; the book has references to the greatness of Einstein, the understanding of time, the dimensions, love, emotions, relationships, scepticism, and belief. I loved it, and will definitely read this again as a book.",
