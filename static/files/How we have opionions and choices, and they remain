How we have opionions and choices, and they remain the same through time.

There was this restaurant I went to about half a year ago with a friend of mine. We went there and I ordered a Falafel wrap and a Mexican wrap.
6 months later, the same restaurant with my friend's best friend, and I had the exact same two wraps. It was only when I saw the sauces in the plate that I realised that these two were the exact same wraps i ordered half a year ago. 
This is human nature. We have mindsets, we have things we like, things we dont. Falefel was somethign I used to have in switzerland and was crazy about it.
